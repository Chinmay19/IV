## Directory layout

This directory should contain the lab assignment code for the intelligent vehicles course at the TU Delft.
The directory has the following structure:

- README.txt        : this file
- utils/      [dir] : directory containing general utility functions
- utils_iv/   [dir] : dir with various utility function used throughout
                      this IV course.

Over time, you will also add the following subdirectories:

- lab1/       [dir] : code for Lab Assignment 1
- lab1_data/  [dir] : provided datasets for Lab Assignment 1
- lab2/       [dir] : code for Lab assignment 2
- lab3/       [dir] : code for Lab assignment 3
- lab3_data/  [dir] : provided datasets for Lab Assignment 3

## Lab assignment directories

The labX/ subdirs will be provided WHEN NEEDED, namely at the start of the assignments first week. So initially, you will be missing a few lab directories.

In addition to the code, lab assignment might also provide datasets, or other binary files used in the assignment.
These should be stored in the labX_data/ subdirectory.

## Getting started with the first lab

- unzip the content of the code archive in a new directory
- start Matlab, and change the path to the lab1/ subdirectory that was unzipped
- open `assignment_eigen_pedestrians.m` and follow the instructions in the lab manual

## Creating an attachment of your solution code

- You should ONLY need to alter code in the labX/ subdirectory
- Therefore, you should ONLY need to submit their labX/ code.
- Do NOT include files from the labX_data/ subdirectory in your ZIP

In conclusion:

   Create a ZIP file of the .m files ONLY in your current labX/ directory.


## Final thoughts ...

Good luck! :)
